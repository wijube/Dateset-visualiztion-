                </div>
                <h2>Data Insights</h2>
                <p>Teenage pregnancy and its repercussions extend beyond mere statistics; they have far-reaching
                    implications for both young mothers and their offspring. Adolescent mothers face heightened risks of
                    severe health complications, including conditions such as eclampsia, puerperal endometritis, and
                    systemic infections, as highlighted by the World Health Organization (WHO, 2023). Equally concerning
                    are the challenges faced by their infants, who are predisposed to low birth weight, preterm birth,
                    and
                    severe neonatal conditions (WHO, 2023).</p>
                <p> Global figures paint a stark reality: in 2019 alone, a staggering 21 million girls under the age of
                    20 experienced pregnancy (WHO, 2023). This issue is not uniform across nations, with the highest
                    rates
                    of teen births among western industrialized countries recorded in the United States (Sedgh et al.,
                    2015).
                    Recent data from 2019 revealed approximately 17.4 births per 1000 females aged 15-19 in the USA,
                    indicating a persistent challenge (CDC, 2021).</p>
                <h2>Interventions</h2>
                <p>Encouragingly, the implementation of publicly funded family planning clinics offering affordable
                    services for adolescents has played a pivotal role in curbing these rates (Elflein, 2023). As a
                    result,
                    an estimated 900,000 pregnancies, births, and abortions among teens in the United States have
                    potentially been averted (Elflein, 2023). Moreover, there has been a commendable rise in
                    contraceptive
                    use among adolescents, contributing significantly to this downward trend (Elflein, 2023).
                </p>
                <h2>Disparities</h2>
                <p>Despite this progress, disparities persist, particularly concerning racial/ethnic and geographic
                    differences in teen birth rates, as highlighted by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention
                    (CDC,
                    2021). Addressing these discrepancies is a priority for local public health authorities, who aim to
                    launch a targeted health campaign aimed at reducing teen pregnancies across diverse racial and
                    ethnic
                    groups.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Recent data underscores the urgency of this initiative, revealing significant gaps among different
                    racial and ethnic populations. For instance, birth rates among Hispanic teens (25.3) and
                    non-Hispanic
                    Black teens (25.8) were more than twice as high as those among non-Hispanic White teens (11.4).
                    Alarmingly, the birth rate among American Indian/Alaska Native teens (29.2) surpassed all other
                    racial/ethnic groups (CDC, 2021).
                </p>
                <h2>Aim of the dataset</h2>
                <p>In the context of this complex issue the dataset
                    collection focuses on contraceptive usage among teenagers belonging to diverse racial and ethnic
                    backgrounds within the age group of 14-20 years.
                    The aim of the dataset is to evaluate the effect of the previously used interventions by public health authorities as the
                    numbers of
                    the teenage pregnancies differ between 2014-2016. Health strategies used previously can be
                    evaluated, improved or the new designed and implemented.

                </p>

                    <iframe src="Visualize_map2014.html" height="440" width="800" frameborder="0" scrolling="no"
                        style="overflow: hidden"></iframe>
                    <iframe src="Visualize_map2016.html" height="450" width="800" frameborder="0" scrolling="no"

                </div>
                <p>The visualization compares the rate of the contraceptive use in the USA between 2014 and 2016.
                    It shows that the usage of the contraceptives by teenagers aged 14-20 has risen. Thus, in some States
                    the health strategies were successful. Public health authorities can also see in which states needs to be
                    more done regarding interventions about teenage pregnancies. 
                    The next step would be to distinguish between diverse racial
                    and ethnic backgrounds to investigate which intervention is more effective in which group.
